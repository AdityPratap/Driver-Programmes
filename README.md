# Driver-Programmes
Codes related to Face detection and openCV in Python.
I am working on the openCV and face recognition models for recognising and securely providing access to the driver.
openCV module is also being used to construct a real-time drowsiness detection environment with the help of dlib library.
You can find all the information about the library and modules in the Python original documentation page. Here is the link to it:
